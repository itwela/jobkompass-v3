# JobKompass — Product Hunt poster briefs

Visual + copy guide for 3 feature posters. Aim: **Product Hunt “best of the day”** — one idea per image, clear hierarchy, sharp UI, confident but not corporate.

---

## Poster 1 — Chat → LaTeX resume (hero)

**Why it’s the hero:** Your main differentiator. First or second image in the gallery.

### Copy

**Header:** Tailor in chat. Get a real resume.

**Smaller text:** AI uses your LaTeX template. Edit in chat, export polished PDFs—no copy-paste, no broken formatting.

### Visual idea

- **Layout:** Split screen or side-by-side. Left = chat UI; right = rendered resume (or PDF preview).
- **Left panel:** Chat thread with 1–2 messages. User message something like: *“Tailor my resume for the Senior PM role at [Stripe / Notion / etc.]”* and a short AI reply. Clean chat bubbles, your app’s font and colors. Optional: small “Resume” or “Cover letter” tab so it’s clear this is doc mode.
- **Right panel:** The actual LaTeX-rendered resume—one column, clear typography, real-looking content (name, role, bullets). So it’s obvious the output is a real document, not markdown or plain text.
- **Emphasis:** The connection between “ask in chat” and “get this doc.” Use a subtle arrow, glow, or same accent color on both sides so the flow reads instantly.
- **Style:** Dark or light is fine; keep contrast high. One accent color (e.g. your primary blue). No clutter—empty states or minimal chrome so the resume and chat are the focus.
- **Optional:** Tiny “Export PDF” or “Download” hint on the resume side to signal “this is the real output.”

## Poster 2 — My Jobs

**Why:** Shows “volume” and control—one place for all applications.

### Copy

**Header:** All your applications. One place.

**Smaller text:** Track status, set follow-ups, and see your pipeline at a glance so nothing slips.

### Visual idea

- **Layout:** Single app frame. Main content = jobs list or grid. Header + your poster copy above or overlaid.
- **Content:** 4–6 job cards/rows. Mix of statuses: Applied, Interview, Offer (or similar). Each row: company logo or initial, role title, company name, status pill/badge, maybe “Follow up in 2 days” or a date.
- **Optional top strip:** Simple stats line—e.g. “12 applied · 3 interviews · 1 offer” or “8 to follow up this week”—so “pipeline at a glance” is visible.
- **One card can be expanded** (slightly larger or with a small detail panel) to show it’s interactive and that you can drill in.
- **Style:** Clean table or card layout. Plenty of whitespace. Status colors (green/orange/blue) used sparingly and consistently. Feels like a dashboard, not a spreadsheet.
- **Mood:** “I’m in control of my job search.” No fake data that looks too perfect—realistic company names and roles help.

## Poster 3 — Performance / stats

**Why:** “Learning from your search” and interview rates—different from generic resume tools.

### Copy

**Header:** See how your search is actually going.

**Smaller text:** Interview rates, follow-up reminders, and a clear view of what’s working.

### Visual idea

- **Layout:** One screen or card. Focus = one main metric or chart + 1–2 supporting numbers.
- **Hero metric:** “Interview rate” or “Applications → interviews” (e.g. “24%” or “3 of 12”). Big, bold number. Optional: small trend (e.g. “↑ from last month” or a tiny sparkline).
- **Supporting:** Simple viz—e.g. applied vs interviews (bar or donut), or a minimal “This week” strip (applied / replied / interviews). Or a short “Follow-ups due” list (2–3 items) to show the reminder angle.
- **Copy on the mock:** You can repeat the poster header above the numbers, or use a short label like “Your pipeline” / “This month” so it reads as a real dashboard.
- **Style:** Same design system as the other two. Prefer one clear chart over many. Dark background with a single accent (e.g. green for positive, blue for neutral) often works well for “stats” on PH.
- **Mood:** “I can see what’s working.” Clean, credible, no chart junk.

## Alternate copy (if you want to A/B test)

| Poster | Alt header 1 | Alt header 2 |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| 1. Chat + resume | Your template. AI’s speed. | Real resumes from the chat. |
| 2. My Jobs | Volume without the chaos. | Track it. Follow up. Move on. |
| 3. Performance | Learn from your search. | Numbers, not guesswork. |

## Product Hunt “best of the day” checklist

- [ ] **One idea per image** — no cramming multiple features into one poster.
- [ ] **Copy hierarchy** — header reads in <2 seconds; smaller text supports, doesn’t repeat.
- [ ] **UI looks real** — actual components, spacing, and colors from (or aligned with) the app.
- [ ] **Consistent style** — same font family, accent color, and tone across all three.
- [ ] **High contrast** — text and key UI elements readable at thumbnail size.
- [ ] **No clutter** — generous whitespace; remove anything that doesn’t support the message.
- [ ] **Order in gallery** — 1 (Chat + resume) first or second; 2 (My Jobs) and 3 (Performance) in either order.
